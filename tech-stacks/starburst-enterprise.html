            Data mesh is primarily an organizational approach, and that's why you can't buy a data mesh from a vendor. Technology, however, is important still as it acts as an enabler for data mesh, and only useful and easy to use solutions will lead to domain teams' acceptance. The available offerings of cloud providers already provide a sufficient set of good self-serve data services to let you form a data platform for your data mesh. We want to show which services can be used to get started.

                Although Starburst is building up its own cloud service Starburst Galaxy, its main product is Starburst Enterprise which you license but have to run yourself or via a managed appliance.

                How would you structure it for your team? Permission?

                    <p>
                        The central piece in Starburst Enterprise is its distributed <strong>query engine</strong> that's built on top of <a href="https://trino.io/">Trino</a>, formerly known PrestoSQL.
                        It allows to query and join data stored in different formats on different data stores on different cloud providers or even on-premise, presuming there's a connector available.
                        In addition to all the connectors that are available with Trino out of the box, Starburst Enterprise adds even more.
                        This means that regardless how you store your ingested analytical data, you will probably be able to process it further with Starburst Enterprise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because of all of these connectors, Starburst makes it easy to <strong>query operational data</strong> directly instead of ingesting it first.
                        You may get started quickly with this approach, but be aware of the downsides such as additional load on the operational data stores or making your queries resilient to breaking changes in the operational schemas.

                        A <strong>data product</strong> in Starburst Enterprise is first and foremost a schema containing one or more (materialized) views that can be accessed through a standardized SQL interface.
                        But it also includes metadata such as tags, a rating, and usage data of the views.
                        The full definition of every data product is available as JSON, and it is recommended to version it in git or to be imported into sophisticated data catalogs, such as <a href="https://marquezproject.github.io/marquez/">marquez</a> or <a href="https://www.amundsen.io/">Amundsen</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Starburst supports a <strong>simple data catalog</strong> as a collection of published data products grouped by data domains.
                        It can act as a starting point but is no replacement for more sophisticated data catalogs.
