        <div class="columns is-vcentered">

                <p>
                    Many organizations have invested in a central data lake and a data team with the
                    expectations to drive their business based on data. However, after a few initial quick wins,
                    they notice that <strong>the central data team often becomes a bottleneck</strong>.
                    The team cannot handle all the analytical questions of management and product owners quickly enough.
                    This is a massive problem because making timely data-driven decisions is crucial to stay competitive.
                    For example,
                    is it a good idea to offer free shipping during Black Week,
                    do customers accept longer but more reliable shipping times,
                    or how does a product page change influences the checkout and returns rate?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data team wants to answer all those questions quickly.
                    In practice, however, they struggle because they need to spend too much time fixing broken data pipelines after operational database changes.
                    In their little time remaining, <strong>the data team has to discover and understand the necessary domain data</strong>.
                    For every question, they need to learn domain knowledge to give meaningful insights.
                    Getting the required domain expertise is a daunting task.

                    On the other hand, organizations have also invested in autonomous domain teams and a decentralized microservice architecture.
                    These <strong>domain teams own and know their domain</strong>, including the information needs of the business.
                    They design, build, and run their web applications and APIs on their own.
                    Despite knowing the domain and the relevant information needs, the domain teams have to reach out to the overloaded central data team to get the necessary data-driven insights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the eventual growth of the organization, the situation of the domain teams and the central data team becomes worse.
                    A way out of this vicious cycle is to shift the responsibility for data from the central data team to the domain teams.
                    This is the core idea behind the Data Mesh concept:
                    <strong>Domain-oriented decentralization for analytical data</strong>.
                    A Data Mesh architecture enables domain teams to perform cross-domain data analysis on their own and interconnects data, similar to APIs in a microservice architecture.

                        The term <em>Data Mesh</em> was coined by <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-mesh-principles.html">Zhamak Dehghani</a> and is based on four fundamental principles that bundle well-known concepts:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <strong>Domain Ownership</strong> principle mandates the domain teams to take responsibility for their data.
                        According to this principle, analytical data should be composed around domains, similar to the team boundaries aligning with the system’s bounded context.
                        Following the domain-driven distributed architecture, analytical and operational data ownership is moved to the domain teams, away from the central data team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <strong>Data as a Product</strong> principle projects a "product thinking" philosophy on analytical data.
                        This principle means that there are consumers for the data beyond the domain.
                        The domain team is responsible for satisfying the needs of other domains by providing high-quality data.
                        Basically, domain data should be treated as any other public API.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The idea behind the <strong>Self-serve Data Infrastructure Platform</strong> is to adopt "platform thinking" to data infrastructure.
                        A dedicated data platform team provides domain-agnostic functionality, tools, and systems to build, execute, and maintain interoperable data products for all domains.
                        With its platform, the data platform team enables domain teams to seamlessly consume and create data products.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <strong>Federated Computational Governance</strong> principle achieves interoperability of all data products through standardization, which is promoted through the whole data mesh by the governance guild.
                        The main goal of federated governance is to create a data ecosystem with adherence to the organizational rules and industry regulations.

        <div class="content">
            <p class="mt-5">
                A Data Mesh Architecture is a decentralized approach that enables domain teams to perform cross-domain data analysis on their own.
                At its core is the domain with its responsible team and its operational and analytical data.
                The domain team ingests operational data and builds analytical data models to perform their own analysis.
                It uses analytical data to build data products based on other domains’ needs.
            </p>
            <img src="images/datamesharchitecture.png" alt="Data Mesh Architecture">
            <p>
                The domain team agrees with others on global policies, such as interoperability, security, and documentation standards in a Federated Governance guild, so that domain teams know how to discover, understand and use data products available in the Data Mesh.
                The self-serving domain-agnostic data platform, provided by the data platform team, enables domain teams to easily build their own data products and do their own analysis effectively.
                An enabling team guides domain teams how to model analytical data, use the data platform, build, and maintain interoperable data products.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s zoom into core components and their relationships of a Data Mesh architecture:
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card mt-5">
            <div class="card-content">
                <h4 class="title is-4">Data Product</h4>
                <div class="columns">
                    <div class="column content">
                        <p>
                            A data product usually is a published <strong>data set</strong> that can be accessed by other domains, similar to an API.
                            For example, the history of inventory updates in a Google BigQuery table
                            or a daily JSON file with purchase orders on an AWS S3 bucket.
                            A data product can take other forms as well, including
                            a sales report containing KPIs and charts as a PDF or even an
                            ML model to predict shipping dates as a <a href="https://onnx.ai/">ONNX</a> file.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To discover, access, and use the data product, it is described with <strong>metadata</strong>, including
                            ownership and contact information, data location and access, update frequency,
                            and a specification of the data model.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The domain team is responsible for the <strong>operations</strong> of the data product during its entire lifecycle.
                            The team needs to continuously monitor and ensure data quality and availability.
                            For example, keep the data without duplicates or react on missing entries.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">

                        <p class="image">

                            Global policies are rules of play in the Data Mesh.
                            They define how the domain teams have to build their data products.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Policies on <strong>interoperability</strong> are the starting point.
                            They allow other domain teams to use data products in a consistent way.
                            For example, global policies could define that the standard way to provide data is as a CSV file on AWS S3 in a bucket owned by the corresponding domain team.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next, there has to be some form of <strong>documentation</strong> to discover and understand available data products.
                            A simple policy for this could be a wiki page with a predefined set of metadata, such as owner of the data product, location url, and descriptions of the CSV fields.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A uniform way to access the actual data product in a <strong>secure</strong> way could be using a role-based access in AWS IAM, managed by the domain team.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Global policies such as <strong>privacy</strong> and <strong>compliance</strong> are also common. Think about protection of personally identifiable information (PII) or industry-specific legal requirements.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                            Diving into the analytical data, we can see the data flows that lead towards the data products.
                            Operational data is often ingested as some kind of <strong>raw</strong> and unstructured data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a preprocessing step, raw data is cleaned and structured into events and entities.
                            <strong>Events</strong> are small, immutable, and highly domain oriented, such as <em>OrderPurchased</em> or <em>ShipmentDelivered</em>.
                            <strong>Entities</strong> represent business objects such as <em>shipments</em> or <em>articles</em> that change over time. That’s why the entities often are represented as a list of snapshots, the history, with the latest snapshot being the current state.
                            In practice, we often see <strong>manually</strong> entered data, we’ve made this explicit here as well.
                            <!-- TBD --> These information objects are domain-private.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The data product is derived by aggregating a subset of the events, entities, manual data, and data products from other teams.
                            It is similar with the internal data analysis of the domain team.
                        </p>

                            How can domain teams ingest their operational data into the data platform?
                            A software system designed according to DDD principles contains data as mutable entities/aggregates and immutable domain events.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Domain events</strong> are a great fit to be ingested into the data platform as they represent relevant business facts.
                            If there’s a messaging system in place domain events can be forwarded to the data platform by attaching an additional message consumer.
                            Data can be collected, processed, and forwarded to the data platform in real-time.
                            With this <strong>streaming ingestion</strong>, data is sent in small batches when they arrive, so they are immediately available for analytics.
                            As domain events are already well-defined, there is little to do in terms of cleaning and preprocessing, except deduplication
                            and anonymization of PII data.
                            Sometimes, it is also advisable, to define and ingest internal analytical events that contain information that is relevant only for analytical use cases, so that domain events don’t have to be modified.
                            <br>
                            <em>Examples for streaming ingestion: Kafka Connect, Kafka Streams, AWS Lambda</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many business objects are persisted as <strong>entities and aggregates</strong> in SQL or NoSQL databases.
                            Their state changes over time and the latest state is persisted in the database, only.
                            Strong candidates for entities with state are <em>articles</em>, <em>prices</em>, <em>customer data</em>, or <em>shipment status</em>.
                            For analytical use cases, it is often required to have both, the latest state and the history of states over time.
                            There are several approaches to ingest entities.
                            One way is to generate and publish an <strong>onCreate/onUpdate/onDelete event</strong> with the current state, every time an entity is changed, e.g. by adding an
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">aspect</a> or <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/api/index.html?org/springframework/data/jpa/domain/support/AuditingEntityListener.html">EntityListeners</a>.
                            Then streaming ingestion can be used to ingest the data as described above.
                            When it is not feasible to change the operational software, <strong>change
                            data capture</strong> may be used to listen to database changes directly and stream them into the data platform.
                            <br>
                            <em>Examples for CDC streaming: <a href="https://debezium.io">debezium</a></em>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lastly, traditional scheduled <strong>ELT or ETL jobs</strong> that export data to file and loads them into the platform can be set up, with the downside of not having realtime-data, not having all stage changes between exports, and some work to consolidate exported data again. However, they are a viable option for legacy systems, such as mainframes.

                            Clean data is the foundation for effective data analytics.
                            With Data Mesh, domain teams are responsible to perform data cleaning.
                            They know their domain and can identify why and how their domain data needs to be processed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Data that is ingested into the data platform is usually imported in its original raw and unstructured format.
                            When using a columnar database, this might be a row per event that contains a
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_large_object">CLOB</a> field for the event payload, which may be in JSON format.

                            Now it can be preprocessed to get data clean:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Structuring:</strong> Transform unstructured and semi-structured data to the analytical data model, e.g. by extracting JSON fields into columns.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mitigation of structural changes:</strong> When data structures have changed, mitigate them, e.g. by filling null-values with sensible defaults.</li>
                            <li><strong>Deduplication:</strong> As most analytical storage systems are append-only, entities and events cannot be updated. Remove all duplicate entries.</li>
                            <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> Ensure that data contains agreed periods, even when there were technical issues during ingestion.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fix outliers:</strong> Invalid data that may occur through bugs get identified and corrected.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            From an implementation perspective, these preprocessing steps can be implemented as simple SQL views that project the raw data.
                            The queries may be organized through
                            <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#with_clause">common table expressions</a> (CTEs)
                            and may be enhanced with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/user-defined-functions">user-defined functions</a> (UDFs), e.g. for JSON processing.
                            As an alternative, the cleaning steps can be implemented as lambda functions that operate on topics.
                            More complex pipelines can be built with frameworks like <a href="https://www.getdbt.com">dbt</a> or
                            <a href="https://beam.apache.org">Apache Beam</a> that offer an advanced programming model,
                            but also requires more skills to master.

                            To gain insights, domain teams query, process and aggregate their analytical data together with relevant data products from other domains.

                            <strong>SQL</strong> is the foundation for most analytical queries.
                            It provides powerful functions to connect and investigate data.
                            The data platform should perform JOIN operations efficiently, even for large data sets.
                            Aggregations are used to group data and window functions help to perform a calculation across multiple rows.
                            Notebooks help to build and document exploratory findings.
                            <br>

                            Humans understand data, trends, and anomalies much easier when they perceive them visually.
                            There are a number of great data <strong>visualization</strong> tools that build beautiful charts, KPIs, dashboards and reports.
                            They provide an easy-to-use UI to drill down, filter and aggregate data.

                            For more advanced insights, <strong>data science and machine learning</strong> methods can be applied.

                        From a technical perspective, Data Mesh relies on data warehouses and data lakes.
                        The data platform gives domain teams the choice, which technology suits best for their use cases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Storing data is a primary purpose of any data platform.
                        As hundreds of terabytes and more may be stored on the platform, storage should be cost-efficient and provide good performance for complex analytical queries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most common are <strong>SQL-like databases</strong> that store data in tables with a structured schema, with the option of semi-structured fields.
                        These databases usually use columnar data stores to retrieve and search large datasets efficiently, hence there is no need for indexes.
                        For smaller datasets it is also possible to use traditional relational databases, but these will require more storage management efforts and index optimizations to build efficient queries.
                        <br>
                        <em>Examples for SQL-like databases: Google BigQuery, AWS Redshift, Azure Synapse Analytics, Snowflake, PostgreSQL</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In some use cases, data needs to be exported from operative or third party systems as files, such as CSV, JSON or XML.
                        The data platform may support storing files in an <strong>object storage</strong>, that can be further processed or analyzed.
                        <br>
                        <em>Examples for object storage: Google Object Store, AWS S3, Git</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For high-volume realtime data, it might be inappropriate to store all events permanently.
                        A <strong>streaming platform</strong> with short-time retention can be the suitable technology to perform real-time analytics.
                        <br>

                    Each team can start their journey whenever they are ready and in their own pace.
                    The benefits arise already along the journey.
                    Teams will quickly gain from first data-driven decisions, starting an avalanche to use more and better data for even deeper insights.
                    The data mesh forms itself with each team that shares their data as products, enabling data-driven innovation.

                <p>
                    To make this journey successful, the team needs three things: a clear data mesh vision from top management to get everybody moving in the same direction, a supportive environment including an easy to use self-serve data platform to get the engineering team on a learning path towards data analytics, and trust to walk the journey in their own way and pace.

                    Being in production, you probably have to investigate an incident and need to analyze how many customers are affected.
                    Also, some stakeholders might have questions regarding your data, such as "Which in-stock articles haven’t been sold in the last 6 months?"
                    or "What were the shipping times during last black week?".
                    To answer all these questions, you send analytical queries to your operational database.
                    Over time, you also do some first explorative analytics to get a deeper understanding of your system’s behaviour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This increases load on your production database, and you might be tempted to change the production database to better support your analytical queries,
                    like creating additional indices.
                    You might offload the additional load to read replicas.
                    But analytical queries are still slow and cumbersome to write.

                    With the pains of slow and hard to write analytical queries in the back of your mind, you try out the self-serve data platform that’s being promoted by the data platform team.
                    For example, you now have access to Google BigQuery.
                    On this platform, your team starts to build an analytical data model from your operational databases.
                    This allows you to analyze data covering your own systems with maintainable and fast queries, while keeping the schemas of your operational databases untouched.
                    You learn how to structure, preprocess, clean, analyze, and visualize analytical data&mdash;that’s a lot to learn even though most is SQL which you are already familiar with.

                    Analyzing own domain data is a great start, but combining it with data from other domains is where the magic begins.
                    It allows to get a comprehensive view despite the decentralization of data.
                    Examples are A/B tests of the effect of a UI change to the conversion rate or building up a machine learning models for fraud detection including previous purchasing history and current click stream behavior.
                    This requires that other teams share their data in a way that your team can discover, access, and use it.
                    This is when the mesh begins to form itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a team becomes a consuming member of the data mesh, it starts to gain interest in the interoperability and governance of the data mesh.
                    Ideally, the team will send a representative to the data mesh governance body.

                    In case you are the first team, you may have to skip this step for now and move on to level 4 and be the first to provide data for others.

                Data Mesh is primarily an organizational construct and relies on the <a href="https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts">principles of team topologies</a>.
                It shifts the responsibilities for data towards domain teams which are supported by a data platform team and a data enabling team.
                Representatives of all teams come together in a federated governance guild to define the common standards.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, in many organizations a central data team is responsible for wide-ranging analytical tasks, from data-engineering to managing data infrastructure to creating C-level reports.
                Such a central data team suffers from cognitive overload, including domain, technical, and methodical knowledge.
                Data Mesh mitigates this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Data Mesh offers new perspectives for members of the central data team as their analytical and data engineering skills remain highly necessary.
                For example, they are a perfect fit to establish the data platform for people that prefer to work on the infrastructure.
                Some of them can form a data enabling team to act as internal consultants, <a href="#domain-teams-journey">helping domain teams on their journey</a>.
                Regardless of their new roles, many of them will meet again in the Data Mesh federated governance guild to shape the future of the Data Mesh.</p>

            The real mind shift, however, happens when founding new data-centric domains as shown in the figure above.
            Let’s look at typical management reports that large central data teams usually produces bases on monolithic data warehouses or data lakes.
            With Data Mesh, the data engineers that created those management reports form a new domain team together with a dedicated product owner.
            As engineers of the new domain team, they now can focus on their new domain and their consumers.
            This allows them to gain deep domain knowledge over time, resulting in better reports and continuous optimizations.
            In addition, they switch from using that monolith data warehouse to data products from other domains.
            This switch is a gradual process driven by the demand for data products, accelerating the forming of a Data Mesh.
            The product owner negotiates with other domain teams about the required data products and makes sure that the reports and other products the new domain team will build in the future fulfills the needs of the business.
        </p>
        <p>
            As existing domain teams on their journey do more and more data analytics, another perspective for members of the central data team is to join one of those existing teams.
            With their existing knowledge, the can accelerate the domain teams’ journey towards a Data Mesh by spreading and teaching their knowledge and skills to the others of the team.
            It is important that they become full members of the team, and not founding a data subteam within the domain team.

            In addition to their knowledge and skills, the data engineers may also bring responsibilities and artefacts from the central data team to their domain teams.
            For example, customer profiling, that was previously done by the central data team, will move into the responsibility of the recommendation domain team.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data scientists, typically, are centrally organized as well.
            That’s why their future, organizational-wise, is quite similar to that of the central data team.
            The data products they focus on are ML features and models.
            When joining an existing domain team, such an ML model might be fully integrated in the systems.

            <p>
                Start small and agree on the big picture.
                Find two domain teams (that are around level 2) that have a high value use case where one team needs data from the other team.
                Let one team build a data product (level 4) and another team use that data product (level 3).

            <h5 class="title">Is Data Mesh for my company?</h5>
            <p>
                It depends, of course.
                There are a few prerequisites that should be in place:
                You should have modularized you software system following Domain-driven Design principles, or something similar.
                You should have a good number (5+) of independent domain teams that have their systems already running in production.
                And finally, you should trust your teams to make data-driven decisions on their own.

            <p>
                At first, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/analytics/data-fabric">Data Fabric</a> looks similar to Data Mesh because it offers a similar self-serve data platform.
                Looking deeper, it turns out Data Fabric is a central and domain-agnostic approach, which stands in stark contrast to the domain-centric and decentralized approach of Data Mesh.
