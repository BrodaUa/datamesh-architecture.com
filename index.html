                <p>
                    To tackle scaling issues, many organizations made a transformation towards domain-oriented teams and systems.
                    But they didn't for analytical data.
                    Central data teams, however, failed to scale giving meaningful insights from data in time.
                    They suffered from limited domain knowledge and insufficient data quality.
<!--                    Domain teams have a deep understanding of their processes and data.-->
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data Mesh adopts the idea of domain-oriented decentralization for analytical data.
                    A Data Mesh Architecture gives domain teams the capabilities to analyze data on their own and to provide data as products to other domains.
                </p>

                    TBD:
                    A central data team import your production database into a central data lake for data analysis and management reports.
                    You might feel uncomfortable that others had direct access to your production databases, violating the principle of information hiding you worked so hard to achieve in your operational systems.
                    Some management reports may include insights on your domain, but you don't really understand how the numbers were calculated and nobody can validate if these were correct.

                <h1 class="title">What is Data Mesh?</h1>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>The term <em>Data Mesh</em> was coined by <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-mesh-principles.html">Zhamak Dehghani</a> and is based on four fundamental principles:</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The <strong>Domain Ownership</strong> principle mandates the domain teams to take responsibility for their data.
                        According to this principle, analytical data should be composed around domains, similar to the team boundaries aligning with the system's bounded context.
                        Following the domain-driven distributed architecture, analytical and operational data ownership is moved to the domain teams, away from the central data team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <strong>Data as a Product</strong> principle projects a "product thinking" philosophy on analytical data.
                        This principle means that there are consumers for the data beyond the domain.
                        The domain team is responsible for satisfying the needs of other domains by providing high-quality data.
                        Basically, domain data should be treated as any other public API.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The idea behind the <strong>Self-serve Data Infrastructure Platform</strong> is to adopt "platform thinking" to data infrastructure.
                        A dedicated data platform team provides domain-agnostic functionality, tools, and systems to build, execute, and maintain interoperable data products for all domains.
                        With its platform, the data platform team enables domain teams to seamlessly consume and create data products.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <strong>Federated Computational Governance</strong> principle achieves interoperability of all data products through standardization, which is promoted through the whole data mesh by the governance guild.
                        The main goal of federated governance is to create a data ecosystem with adherence to the organizational rules and industry regulations.

            <p class="mt-5">
                At the core of any Data Mesh Architecture is the domain with its responsible team and its operational and analytical data.
                The domain team ingests operational data and builds analytical data models to perform their own analysis.
                It uses analytical data to build data products based on other domains' needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The domain team agrees with others on global policies, such as interoperability, security, and documentation standards, in a Federated Governance guild, so that domain teams know how to discover, understand and use data products available in the Data Mesh.
                The self-serving domain-agnostic data platform, provided by the data platform team, enables domain teams to easily build their own data products and do their own analysis effectively.
                An enablement team guides domain teams how to model analytical data, use the data platform, build, and maintain interoperable data products.

                                    A data product usually is a published <strong>data set</strong>, similar to an API.
                                    The data itself is curated for the use by other domains.
                                    For example, the history of inventory updates of articles in a Google BigQuery table
                                    or a JSON file per day with purchase orders on an AWS S3 bucket.
                                    A data product can take other forms as well, including
                                    a sales report containing KPIs and charts as a PDF or even an
                                    ML model in <a href="https://onnx.ai/">ONNX</a> format to predict shipping dates.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To discover, access, and use the data product, it is described with <strong>metadata</strong>, including
                                    ownership and contact information, data location and access, update frequency,
                                    and a specification of the data model.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The domain team is responsible for the <strong>operations</strong> of the data product during its entire lifecycle.
                                    The team needs to continuously monitor and ensure data quality and availability.
                                    For example, keep the data without duplicates or react on missing entries.

                                    Global policies are rules of play in the Data Mesh.
                                    They define how the domain teams have to build their data products.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Policies on <strong>interoperability</strong> are the starting point.
                                    They allow other domain teams to use data products in a consistent way.
                                    For example, global policies could define that the standard way to provide data is as a CSV file on AWS S3 in a bucket owned by the corresponding domain team.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Next, there has to be some form of <strong>documentation</strong> to discover and understand available data products.
                                    A simple policy for this could be a wiki page with a predefined set of metadata, such as owner of the data product, location url, and descriptions of the CSV fields.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A uniform way to access the actual data product in a <strong>secure</strong> way could be using a role-based access in AWS IAM, managed by the domain team.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Global policies such as <strong>privacy</strong> and <strong>compliance</strong> are also common. Think about protection of personally identifiable information (PII) or industry-specific legal requirements.

                                   Diving into the analytical data, we can see the data flows that lead towards the data products.
                                    Operational data is often ingested as some kind of <strong>raw</strong> and unstructured data.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In a preprocessing step, raw data is cleaned and structured into events and entities.
                                    <strong>Events</strong> are small, immutable, and highly domain oriented, such as <em>OrderPurchased</em> or <em>ShipmentDelivered</em>.
                                    <strong>Entities</strong> represent business objects such as <em>shipments</em> or <em>articles</em> that change over time. That's why the entities often are represented as a list of snapshots, the history, with the latest snapshot being the current state.
                                    In practice, we often see <strong>manually</strong> entered data, we've made this explicit here as well.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                   The data product is derived by aggregating a subset of the events, entities, manual data, and data products from other teams.
                                   It is similar with the internal data analysis of the domain team.

                                    - entities: more work, add onCreate/onUpdate events with current state with onDelete tombstones -> similar to domain events, or alternatively CDC with filter/transformation either in ingest or clean step towards an entity history

                        <p>
                            Storing data is a primary purpose of any data platform.
                            As hundreds of terabytes and more may be stored on the platform, storage should be cost-efficient and provide good performance for complex analytical queries.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most common are <strong>SQL-like databases</strong> that store data in tables with a structured schema, with the option of semi-structured fields.
                            These databases usually use columnar data stores to retrieve and search large datasets efficiently, hence there is no need for indexes.
                            For smaller datasets it is also possible to use traditional relational databases, but these will require more storage management efforts and index optimizations to build efficient queries.
                            <br>
                            <em>Examples for SQL-like databases: Google BigQuery, AWS Redshift, Azure Synapse Analytics, Snowflake, PostgreSQL</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In some use cases, data needs to be exported from operative or third party systems as files, such as CSV, JSON or XML.
                            The data platform may need support to store files in an <strong>object storage</strong>, that can be further processed or analyzed.
                            <br>
                            <em>Examples for object storage: Google Object Store, AWS S3, Git</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For high-volume realtime data, it might be inappropriate to store all events permanently.
                            A <strong>streaming platform</strong> with short-time retention can be the suitable technology to perform realtime analytics.

                    Each of your domain teams has to go on a journey to become a contributing part of your data mesh.
                    Each team can start their journey whenever they are ready and in their own pace.
                    The benefits arise already along the journey.
                    Teams will quickly gain from first data-driven decisions, starting an avalanche to use more and better data for even deeper insights.
                    The data mesh forms itself with each team that shares their data as products, enabling data-driven innovation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make this journey successful, the team needs three things: a clear data mesh vision from top management to get everybody moving in the same direction, a supportive environment including an easy to use self-serve data platform to get the engineering team on a learning path towards data analytics, and trust to walk the journey in their own way and pace.
                </p>

                    Being in production, you probably have to investigate an incident and need to analyze how many customers are affected.
                    Also, some stakeholders might have questions regarding your data, such as "Which in-stock articles haven't been sold in the last 6 months?"
                    or "What were the shipping times during last black week?".
                    To answer all these questions, you send analytical queries to your operational database.
                    Over time, you also do some first explorative analytics to get a deeper understanding of your system's behaviour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This increases load on your production database, and you might be tempted to change the production database to better support your analytical queries,
                    like creating additional indices.
                    You might offload the additional load to read replicas.
                    But analytical queries are still slow and cumbersome to write.

                    With the pains of slow and hard to write analytical queries in the back of your mind, you try out the self-serve data platform that's being promoted by the data platform team.
                    For example, you now have access to Google BigQuery.
                    On this platform, your team starts to build an analytical data model from your operational databases.
                    This allows you to analyze data covering your own systems with maintainable and fast queries, while keeping the schemas of your operational databases untouched.
                    You learn how to structure, preprocess, clean, analyze, and visualize analytical data&mdash;that's a lot to learn even though most is SQL which you are already familiar with.

                    Analyzing own domain data is a great start, but combining it with data from other domains is where the magic begins.
                    It allows to get a comprehensive view despite the decentralization of data.
                    Examples are A/B tests of the effect of a UI change to the conversion rate or building up a machine learning models for fraud detection including previous purchasing history and current click stream behavior.
                    This requires that other teams share their data in a way that your team can discover, access, and use it.
                    This is when the mesh begins to form itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a team becomes a consuming member of the data mesh, it starts to gain interest in the interoperability and governance of the data mesh.
                    Ideally, the team will send a representative to the data mesh governance body.

                    In case you are the first team, you may have to skip this step for now and move on to level 4 and be the first to provide data for others.

                    For example, you provide the confirmed, rejected, and aborted orders so others can correlate their events to the conversion rate.
                    Instead of just being a consumer of data products, you become a producer of data products.
                    You generate value for other teams.

            Data Mesh is primarily an organizational construct and relies on the <a href="https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts">principles of team topologies</a>.
            It shifts the responsibilities for data towards domain teams which are supported by a data platform team and a data enablement team.
            Representatives of all teams come together in a federated governance guild to define the common standards.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, in many organizations a central data team is responsible for wide-ranging analytical tasks, from data-engineering to managing data infrastructure to creating C-level reports.
            Such a central data team suffers from cognitive overload, including domain, technical, and methodical knowledge.
            Data Mesh mitigates this.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data Mesh offers new perspectives for members of the central data team as their analytical and data engineering skills remain highly necessary.
            For example, they are a perfect fit to establish the data platform for people that prefer to work on the infrastructure.
            Some of them can form a data enablement team to act as internal consultants, <a href="#domain-teams-journey">helping domain teams on their journey</a>.
            Regardless of their new roles, many of them will meet again in the Data Mesh federated governance guild to shape the future of the Data Mesh.
        </p>
            <img src="images/newdomainteam.svg" alt="">
        <p>
            The real mind shift, however, happens when founding new data-centric domains as shown in the figure above.
            Let's look at typical management reports that large central data teams usually produces bases on monolithic data warehouses or data lakes.
            With Data Mesh, the data engineers that created those management reports form a new domain team together with a dedicated product owner.
            As engineers of the new domain team, they now can focus on their new domain and their consumers.
            This allows them to gain deep domain knowledge over time, resulting in better reports and continuous optimizations.
            In addition, they switch from using that monolith data warehouse to data products from other domains.
            This switch is a gradual process driven by the demand for data products, accelerating the forming of a Data Mesh.
            The product owner negotiates with other domain teams about the required data products and makes sure that the reports and other products the new domain team will build in the future fulfills the needs of the business.
        </p>
        <p>
            As existing domain teams on their journey do more and more data analytics, another perspective for members of the central data team is to join one of those existing teams.
            With their existing knowledge, the can accelerate the domain teams' journey towards a Data Mesh by spreading and teaching their knowledge and skills to the others of the team.
            It is important that they become full members of the team, and not founding a data subteam within the domain team.

            In addition to their knowledge and skills, the data engineers may also bring responsibilities and artefacts from the central data team to their domain teams.
            For example, customer profiling, that was previously done by the central data team, will move into the responsibility of the recommendation domain team.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data scientists, typically, are centrally organized as well.
            That's why their future, organizational-wise, is quite similar to that of the central data team.
            The data products they focus on are ML features and models.
            When joining an existing domain team, such an ML model might be fully integrated in the systems.

                <strong>Data Mesh vs. Data Fabric?</strong>
                <br/>
                At first, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/analytics/data-fabric">Data Fabric</a> looks similar to Data Mesh because it offers a similar self-serve data platform.
                Looking deeper, it turns out Data Fabric is a central and domain-agnostic approach, which stands in stark contrast to the domain-centric and decentralized approach of Data Mesh.
