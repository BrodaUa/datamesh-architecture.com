# Data Mesh Architecture: Data Mesh from an Engineering Perspective

Today, data analysis is central to the success of companies, but it's hard to scale.
Data Mesh adresses the issue of scaling of a central data team in a world of decentralised domain teams.
The goal of this website is to *focus on the engineering perspective of the domain teams* and to give advice and examples how to organize, build, and operate a Data Mesh within your organization.

> **Data Mesh Architecture** is a decentralised architecture that enables domain teams to perform cross-domain data analysis on their own.

- [ ] TODO: Picture of the Data Mesh Concept.

In 2019, the term *Data Mesh* was coined by [Zhamak Dehghani](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html).

## Why

![](datamesh-overview.jpg)

- status quo 1: Value proposition perspective
 - innovative product development: improve existing products or create new products


status quo 2: Engineering perspective
### Microservices / SCS
- self-serve data platform
### Domain-Driven Design
 domain ownership on data, 
 data as a product, 
### Autonomous Teams 
 computational federated governance


## Data Mesh Principles
It builds upon four principles: 

 1. domain ownership on data, 
 1. data as a product, 
 1. self-serve data platform, and 
 1. computational federated governance.
