# Data Mesh Architecture

**Data Mesh Architecture** is a decentralised architecture that enables domain teams to perform cross-domain data analysis on their own.

## Data Mesh from an Engineering Perspective

![](4steps-Status Quo.drawio.svg)

Data Mesh is the next step in the decentralization movement that started with strategic domain-driven design, lead to autonomous domain teams that own their self-contained systems or microservices.

Data Mesh is an advanced concept which requires the following prerequisites:
1. Domain split into domains/bounded context
2. IT Department split into autonomous domain teams
3. Monolith to self-contained systems/microservices
