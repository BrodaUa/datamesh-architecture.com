# Data Mesh Architecture: Data Mesh from an Engineering Perspective

Today, data analysis is central to the success of companies, but it's hard to scale.
Data Mesh adresses the issue of scaling of a central data team in a world of decentralised domain teams.

The goal of this website is to *focus on the engineering perspective of the domain teams* and to give advice and examples how to organize, build, and operate a Data Mesh within your organization.

> **Data Mesh Architecture** is a decentralised architecture that enables domain teams to perform cross-domain data analysis on their own.
