# Data Mesh Architecture: Data Mesh from an Engineering Perspective

Today, data analysis is central to the success of companies, but it's hard to scale.
Data Mesh adresses the issue of scaling of a central data team in a world of decentralised domain teams.
The goal of this website is to *focus on the engineering perspective of the domain teams* and to give advice and examples how to organize, build, and operate a Data Mesh within your organization.

> **Data Mesh Architecture** is a decentralised architecture that enables domain teams to perform cross-domain data analysis on their own.

## What

In software engineering, we shifted from central IT department with a central monolithic software systems to autonomous domain teams with decentralised software systems. Data analytics still happens by a central data team. This lack of domain knowledge leads to disappointingly slow and bad . 








Data Mesh adresses the issue of scaling and data quality of a central data team in a world of decentralised domain teams.
In 2019, the term *Data Mesh* was coined by [Zhamak Dehghani](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html).
In our experience, the people curious about data mesh are mostly database administrators, data engineers, data scientists, or data architects. 
And those people then typically drive the introduction of a data mesh as a top-down approach, splitting up the central data team.
We think it is important to look at the data mesh from the domain teams software engineering perspective as well.

We want to give advice and examples how to organize, build, and operate a *Data Mesh Architecture* within your organization.


- Short description with the four principles
- Data Mesh Architecture: Data Mesh from an engineering perspective
- Definition: Data Mesh Architecture is a decentralised architecture that enables domain teams to perform cross-domain data analysis on their own.

Why
- innovative product development: improve existing products or create new products

## Data Mesh Principles
It builds upon four principles: 

 1. domain ownership on data, 
 1. data as a product, 
 1. self-serve data platform, and 
 1. computational federated governance.
