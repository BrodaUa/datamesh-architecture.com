                How is this supposed to work in practice?
                Data mesh shifts responsibilities to the engineering teams. Once again.
                The full stack becomes even <em>fuller</em>.
                In addition to frontend, backend, mobile apps, databases, operations, security, and more, they are now also expected to perform data analysis and publish high quality data products.
                Many teams are already more than busy implementing the user stories in their ever-growing backlog and managing their technical debt.
                And we haven't talked about the guild meetings and work sessions yet.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                This is a valid concern.
                In our experience, it's not not a question of prioritizati
                In the end, this boils down to the question of prioritization and culture.
                Do the domain teams expect to see a high return on invest for themselves and the whole company when implementing a data mesh?
                There's a ton of resources out there that advocates for data mesh.
            </p>
            <p>
                But let's assume you've got an initial buy-in from the domain teams, and they start building up a data mesh. Here are the typical challenges that domain teams face along their journey.
            </p>

    <section class="section content">
        <h4 class="title is-4">Know How</h4>
        <p>
            Operational domain teams have a lot of experience with frontend and backend technologies, along with SQL and No-SQL databases, Kafka, and runtime platforms like Kubernetes.
            Managing data for analytical use cases needs additional know how, particularly for performance and cost optimization:
            How to efficiently transfer data from Kafka to S3?
            Single events get expensive and may take too long.
            Building batches increases latency and,
            more importantly, may lead to inconsistencies.
            JSON as storage format takes too much space and costs, so engineers need to learn Parquet or Avro.
            When you need a data pipeline that is built on Spark (what to consider very carefully), you suddenly need to learn Python.
            While SQL is well-known to most engineers, more analytical queries may require features you have to learn, such as aggregations and window functions.
            Also, visualization of data is a new competency that requires know how to build meaningful and correct charts.
            And we did not event get into data science and machine learning yet.
        </p>

        <h4 class="title is-4">Teams are different. So are domains.</h4>
        <p>
            In an ideal world, each team could develop a data product and profit right away through analytics.
            In practice, this is not true for all teams.
            Teams may be on <a href="https://www.datamesh-architecture.com/#level-1-operational-database-queries">level 1</a>
            and gain good-enough results running queries on operational databases may have no immediate benefit to go the journey to level 4 to make their data available for other teams.
            Other teams may not profit from analytics, as their business is driven by fulfilling standardized processes,
            or they use standard software that already has good reporting for their domain.
            And there may be teams that just started implementing new services and are not yet in production.
            So the readiness or willingness to offer a data product is not always given.
            Enforcing them to build data products puts even more burden on their shoulders.
            If the organization pushes data mesh, teams will be requested quite often “when do we get your data?”.
            When they finally agree to provide data, but struggle with the setup, there may be data quality issues that may lead to false insights for data consumers.

                Restrain to add more engineers to the team.
                Instead, agree with the team and their stakeholders that data analytics is an investment they want to make and give it priority.
                Implementing a first data product may take up to 4 weeks or more.
                <br/>
                Aim for teams participating in a Data Mesh to <strong>achieve benefits from analyzing data</strong> that are higher than the investment in the long term.
                For example, they measure the business value of user stories before implementing,
                and make a qualified decision that certain user stories are <em>not worth implementing</em>, freeing up capacities.
                With their own domain data analytics, they can focus on the user stories that provide the highest business value, proven by data.
                This requires that managers give teams the freedom and trust to choose user stories themselves and not be driven by external projects or milestones.
                Data Mesh requires a true culture of product thinking and autonomous teams.

                Trust your team that they will learn the required skills, but don’t underestimate the time they need to master.
                Make sure that the whole team does data analytics, not just a single data analyst.
                <strong>Establish an enabling team</strong> that accompanies domain teams with their first steps building analytical models and building first data products.
                They show how to solve typical use cases, like ingesting Kafka messages into the data platform using best practices.
                Embrace <em>dbt</em>, it is a developer-friendly framework that engineers use to build and test data models.
                When designing the data platform, it should serve primarily the needs of domain teams’ engineers.
                SQL-like integrated data warehouses (such as BigQuery or Snowflake) may be more appropriate than modular platforms (like files on S3 with Presto) or data science oriented platforms (such as Spark).

            - Start with domains that are mature.
            - Not every domain must participate in a data mesh
            - Accept the fact that the local ROI may be unbalanced, make clear that the org as a whole benefits.
            - Appreciate data products, as you do with other features
