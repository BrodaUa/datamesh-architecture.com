                Implementing data mesh is nontrivial and highly dependent on the organization.
                Here, we capture real world learnings based on observations and experiences, so you might be able to get something out of it for your own data mesh journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                We want this collection of real world learnings to be a community effort. Please share your observations and learnings <a href="https://www.datamesh-architecture.com/#authors">with us</a> so we can put them up here for you, or <a href="https://github.com/datamesh-architecture/datamesh-architecture.com/edit/main/real-world-learnings.html">add them yourself via a pull request yourself</a>.

                    How to efficiently transfer data from Kafka to S3?
                    Single events that we have in production got expensive and took too long to process.

                Restrain to add more engineers to the team.
                Instead, agree with the team and their stakeholders that data analytics is an investment they want to make and give it priority.
                Implementing a first data product may take up to 4 weeks or more.
                <br/>
                Aim for teams participating in a Data Mesh to <strong>achieve benefits from analyzing data</strong> that are higher than the investment in the long term.
                For example, they measure the business value of user stories before implementing,
                and make a qualified decision that certain user stories are <em>not worth implementing</em>, freeing up capacities.
                With their own domain data analytics, they can focus on the user stories that provide the highest business value, proven by data.
                This requires that managers give teams the freedom and trust to choose user stories themselves and not be driven by external projects or milestones.
                Data Mesh requires a true culture of product thinking and autonomous teams.

                Trust your team that they will learn the required skills, but don’t underestimate the time they need to master.
                Make sure that the whole team does data analytics, not just a single data analyst.
                <strong>Establish an enabling team</strong> that accompanies domain teams with their first steps building analytical models and building first data products.
                They show how to solve typical use cases, like ingesting Kafka messages into the data platform using best practices.
                Embrace <em>dbt</em>, it is a developer-friendly framework that engineers use to build and test data models.
                When designing the data platform, it should serve primarily the needs of domain teams’ engineers.
                SQL-like integrated data warehouses (such as BigQuery or Snowflake) may be more appropriate than modular platforms (like files on S3 with Presto) or data science oriented platforms (such as Spark).

            <h6>How to tackle</h6>

            - Start with domains that are mature.
            - Not every domain must participate in a data mesh
            - Accept the fact that the local ROI may be unbalanced, make clear that the org as a whole benefits.
            - Appreciate data products, as you do with other features
